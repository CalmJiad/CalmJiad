I’m Ekramul Haque Jiad, a front-end web developer, creative coder and self-proclaimed designer who specializes in both front-end and back-end development. I mostly love to develop cross-platform web applications, debug ticklish issues and conflicting bugs, and do most things using Javascript. I believe that I am diligent and careful at contributing to a highly collaborative work environment and finding solutions.
